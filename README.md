## Technical task:

Create a simple web site for users to create/submit articles and post comments. Add user management and authentication. 
Start from back-end implementation!
	
## Back-end

### Complete application must meet the following criterias:
- Application should be written with .NET CORE 3.x by using REST architecture (use HTTP and JSON) as a microservice;
- Authentication (choose any method). Only authenticated users can post articles and comments;
- Any user can view content. User information should consist of UserName, Email and Password. Not allowed to create two users with identical name or email;    --
- Article length can't be more than 2000 symbols. Article required fields: Title, CreatedUser, CreatedDate, *Category;
- Comment length is limited to 200 symbols; 
- User can't create a post with already existing article title;
- `*`Add articles search by partial title occurrence, user name or *category;
- `*`Add functionality to restore forgotten passwords with email notification. Send new password to user.

*P.S. Add middleware to handle exceptions.*

## Unit Testing (Required)
- Cover back-end implementation with Unit Tests (any framework allowed: NUnit, Xunit, MSTest etc.);
- `*`Add integrations tests for articles workflow;
- `**`Add code coverage tool to check.

## UI
- Choose any familiar framework/library to achieve results as fast as possible (Angular, React, Vue, JQuery etc.);
- Create 3 pages: Login Page, Articles list (just titles) and article view (whole post with comments below);
- Add a current logged in user indication in the header;
- `*`Add a search bar (see back-end part requirements). Replace an articles list with search results;
- `*`Allow users to choose category of their posts (show category tag).
	 
*P.S. Don't spend too much time on UI. Create as simple as possible. Use existing layouts and libraries. If you don't have time - skip UI implementation and use Postman of Swagger instead.*

## DB
- Use MongoDB (allowed to use any nuget packages for DB connection) to store all necessary information;
- Provide CRUD operations for each document.

## Other
- Write documentation with public API explanation and usages, how to start your application and required environment;

## Additional tasks:
- `**`Deploy and run microservice inside Docker.

## Legend
- `*` - Additional requirements (implement main part first);
- `**` - The lowest priority. Do other tasks first.
